# Dataset
Datasets play a crucial role in machine learning tasks, as the quality and quantity of the data determine the success of any model built. A dataset is a collection of data points that are used to train and validate a machine learning model. A good dataset should be diverse, accurate, and balanced, allowing the model to generalize well to unseen data.
